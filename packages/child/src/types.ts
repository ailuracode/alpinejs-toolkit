 *   missing on the child. Existing child `id`, `aria-*`, and `data-*`
 *   attributes always win.
 * - `'merge'` — explicit alias for `'default'`. Surfaced via the
 *   `.merge` modifier; reserved as a distinct variant so future
 *   semantics (e.g. deep attribute merging) can branch on it without
 *   breaking the modifier contract.
 * - `'replace'` — wrapper values overwrite child values on conflict.
 *   `class` and `style` still merge token/property lists.
